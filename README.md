# Hypervelocity-Stars

Welcome to the Hypervelocity Stars project! This project focuses on simulating the orbital dynamics of a binary star system interacting with a massive black hole. Through numerical simulations, we aim to understand how gravitational interactions shape the trajectories and energies of stars in such systems.

**Problem Statement:**

Consider a binary star system revolving around a massive black hole with specified masses and initial conditions. The binary system is assumed to be in a circular orbit with a given separation when located well outside the black hole's tidal radius. Initially injected into a parabolic orbit around the black hole the system's evolution is tracked numerically.

**Usage:**

To explore the behavior of the binary star system and solve specific tasks, follow the instructions below:

(a) **Orbital Evolution**: 
   - Run the code to simulate the orbital evolution of the binary star system.
   - Expect to find plots illustrating the dimensionless positions of the two stars, representing their orbits around the black hole.

(b) **Relative Position Evolution**: 
   - Run the code to analyze the relative position evolution of the secondary star with respect to the primary star.
   - Expect to find plots illustrating the dimensionless relative position of the secondary star with respect to the primary star in the comoving frame of the primary.

(c) **Energy Evolution**: 
   - Run the code to track the energy evolution of the binary star system.
   - Expect to find plots illustrating the energies of the two stars, Ep and Es, as functions of time.

(d) **Closer Encounter Case**: 
   - Run the code to explore the scenario with a closer encounter between the binary star system and the black hole.
   - Expect to find plots illustrating the orbital behavior and energy evolution under the conditions of a significantly reduced periastron distance compared to the initial setup.
